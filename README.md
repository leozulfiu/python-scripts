# useful python scripts

I have these python scripts in my PATH variable which I use frequently on a daily basis.

**syn** gives you synonyms to a given word

**kw** gives you the current calendar week

## Installation

You can just download/clone and use it.
Some scripts need additional dependencies. See list below.

* syn: lxml, requests
* kw: datetime

## Usage

### syn
For the syn script I parse the output of http://synonyme.woxikon.de/

		syn word
		
Example

	zurücktreten
	abdanken
	sterben
	abfahren

	...
```
### kw

use without any arguments
